        heading="About Me" 
        body="I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (BTech) in Computer Science at Navrachana University, Vadodara. With a deep curiosity for technology and a passion for solving complex challenges, 
        I enjoy exploring the intricate workings of modern computing. Beyond building technical expertise, 
        I am committed to developing essential skills like effective communication, adaptability, and teamworkâ€”qualities that are crucial in todayâ€™s fast-paced tech industry.
        I thrive on both academic and hands-on learning, always eager to apply engineering principles in real-world scenarios. Recently, I secured 2nd place in a hackathon, where I worked on a Deep Fake Detection System using AI and ML. This experience reinforced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of cutting-edge technologies.
        I am always open to new learning opportunities and excited to take on challenges that push my boundaries."
